Primitive ATM System Project
Project Idea
This is a simple ATM system project that integrates with the files of the previously created bank project. It allows users to log in through their bank account and perform basic operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, or checking balanceâ€”all while focusing solely on the basic principles of programming.

Project Components
Login System

Users log in using their bank account credentials from the previous bank project.
ATM Menu

The ATM menu offers the following operations:
Withdraw Money: Allows users to withdraw funds from their account.
Add Money: Lets users deposit money into their account.
Check Balance: Enables users to view their current account balance.
File Integration

The project is linked to the files of the previous bank project, ensuring that the user data and account details are maintained across both systems.
Basic Programming Concepts

The system uses fundamental programming concepts to achieve functionality, making it a perfect learning project for beginners.
Project Goals
Hands-On Learning: Focuses on reinforcing the basics of programming while working with file handling and user management.
Functionality Integration: Combines essential banking operations with a simple ATM interface.
